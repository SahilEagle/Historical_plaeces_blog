        <p>An architectural gem and one of the most exquisite historical places in India is Fatehpur Sikri, a town in the Agra district of Uttar Pradesh. A recognized UNESCO World Heritage Site, Fatehpur Sikri is made predominantly out of red sandstone, and dates back to the late 16th century, when it was founded by Mughal Emperor Akbar.

            Fatehpur Sikri is completely fortified, and as of now, serves as the abode of Jodha Baiâ€™s Palace, Buland Darwaza, Jama Masjid, Ibadat Khana, as well as the Tomb of Salim Chishti and other attractions.
