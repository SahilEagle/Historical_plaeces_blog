        <p>Hawa Mahal in Jaipur is one of the best historical places in India, in addition to being a prominent landmark of Rajasthan. Dating back to the 18th century, Hawa Mahal is a 5-storey structure that overlooks the bustling streets of Jaipur. It has also been made in a blend of the Rajput, Mughal and Islamic styles of architecture.

            Built by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the Hawa Mahal has been constructed in a way such that the small windows here allow winds to enter the palace and keep it cool during the blazing hot summers.
