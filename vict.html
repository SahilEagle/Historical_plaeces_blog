        <p>Ranking amongst the top 10 historical places in India, Kolkataâ€™s Victoria Memorial was constructed in honour of Queen Victoria, making it one of the relics of the British Raj. Built entirely out of white marble, the Victoria Memorial is almost a replica of its namesake in London.

            Surrounded by a well-manicured garden on all sides, it is home to a wide number of sculptures, artwork, statues and more. You can also find a 16-foot-tall bronze statue of the Angel of Victory on top of the central dome of the Victoria Memorial.
            
            Entry fee: INR 30 (Indians), INR 500 (Foreigners); INR 100 (SAARC and BIMSTEC), FREE (for school children and army veterans)
