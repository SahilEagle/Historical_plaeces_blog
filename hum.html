        <p>Amongst the oldest historical places in India, Humayun’s Tomb in Delhi, along the banks of the Yamuna River, was also the first garden-tomb in the country. Built by Emperor Humayun’s wife in memory of her husband in the 16th century, this monument is surrounded by double-storied gateways and four gardens, and looks simply phenomenal.

            In addition to the final resting place of Humayun, this place also contains around 150 other tombs. Built of red sandstone, the design of Humayun’s Tomb is similar to the Mughal style of architecture, complete with Persian influences.
