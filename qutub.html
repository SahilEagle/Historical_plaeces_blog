        <p>Delhiâ€™s Qutub Minar ranks amongst the top 10 historical places in India. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Qutub Minar, also known as the Victory Tower, is the tallest brick minaret in the whole world, standing tall at a height of 72.5 metres. Built of marble and red sandstone, you can also see many beautiful carvings and intricate designs of the Qutub Minar.

            The Qutub Minar was built in the late 1100s, to celebrate Muslim Dominance in Delhi, after its last Hindu ruler was defeated. The construction was commenced by Qutab-ud-din Aibak, followed by his successors Iltutmish and Firoz Shah Tughlak.
